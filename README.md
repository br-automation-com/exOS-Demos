# exOS-Demos
exOS demo components from video tutorials

## Frameworks

These [demo components][link_frameworks] showcase a way to have an existing framework in Linux, and have exOS deploy microservices that are connecting to this framework.

## NodeRed

This [demo][link_nodered] showcases a node-red application (including node-red itself) packaged as an exOS component, with an exOS application forwarding an AR structure via Linux to node-red using MQTT and getting the response from the node-red application back to AR.
