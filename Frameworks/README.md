# Using exOS with existing frameworks

This set of example components showcases how you can use exOS together 
with existing Linux frameworks, whereas the "framework" in this case is
a simple nodejs webserver which uses a node-ipc. The "microservices" that
are deployed with exOS are connecting to the "framework" via this node-ipc.
